Date: [DD] February 2026

Benguela Current Convention (BCC) Secretariat
No. 1 Strand Street

Swakopmund, Namibia

**Re: Expression of Interest - Revamping and Re-Designing of the BCC Website**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I, Job Angula, the Principal Consultant and sole proprietor of **Job Angula Technology Consulting**, hereby submit this Expression of Interest in response to the call for the design, development, implementation, and hosting of the Benguela Current Convention (BCC) website.

Job Angula Technology Consulting is a Namibian-based technology consulting firm specialising in custom web application development, website design, content management systems, and digital solutions for organisations across Southern Africa. We have a demonstrated track record of delivering modern, responsive, and user-friendly web platforms for both private and public sector clients.

We understand that the BCC requires a website that is interactive, modern, and reflective of its identity as the world's first intergovernmental Convention based on a multi-sectoral approach to Large Marine Ecosystem ocean governance. We are confident that our expertise in building custom, tailor-made content management systems and modern web applications positions us uniquely to deliver a solution that meets and exceeds the BCC's expectations.

Our approach centres on building a bespoke Content Management System specifically engineered for BCC's operational needs -- enabling your Secretariat staff to independently manage bilingual content (English and Portuguese), upload documents, manage media, and maintain the website without requiring technical expertise. This custom approach eliminates the security vulnerabilities and bloat associated with off-the-shelf CMS platforms while providing exactly the features BCC needs.

We are committed to delivering a high-quality, secure, and fully functional website within the stipulated timelines, and to providing reliable hosting and maintenance services for the three-year contract period.

We look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the BCC's digital transformation and enhanced stakeholder engagement.

Yours faithfully,

## SECTION C: TECHNICAL PROPOSAL

---

### 1. Understanding of the Terms of Reference

The Benguela Current Convention (BCC) is a pioneering intergovernmental organisation established by Angola, Namibia, and South Africa to promote integrated management and sustainable development of the Benguela Current Large Marine Ecosystem. As the first convention in the world based on a multi-sectoral approach to Large Marine Ecosystem ocean governance, BCC occupies a unique and prestigious position in the global marine conservation landscape.

The BCC Secretariat, based in Swakopmund, serves as the operational hub coordinating activities across the three member states. The Secretariat communicates with a diverse stakeholder base -- including policy makers, administrators, technocrats, academics, students, the private sector, and the general public -- in both English and Portuguese. A modern, professional website is central to this communication mandate.

**We understand the core requirements to be:**

1. **Website Revamp** -- A complete redesign delivering a modern, interactive, and professional web presence that reflects BCC's identity and stature as a leading marine governance organisation
2. **Bilingual Platform** -- Full dual-language support in English and Portuguese with seamless switching (translation content provided by BCC internally)
3. **Custom CMS** -- A robust yet intuitive content management system enabling BCC Secretariat staff to independently manage and update all website content without technical assistance
4. **Document Repository** -- A secure, organised repository for reports, research outputs, policy documents, and publications
5. **Stakeholder Engagement** -- Social media integration, newsletter/mailing list subscription, and interactive features to strengthen BCC's online engagement
6. **Hosting & Maintenance** -- Reliable, secure hosting for the BCC website and the BCLME RIIMS platform for a period of three years
7. **Training & Handover** -- Comprehensive training for designated Secretariat staff with supporting user manuals
8. **Compliance** -- Adherence to data protection regulations and web accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1)

### 2. Proposed Technical Approach

#### 2.1 Why a Custom CMS

Rather than relying on off-the-shelf platforms such as WordPress or Drupal, we propose building a **bespoke Content Management System** specifically engineered for BCC's needs. This approach offers significant advantages:

| Factor | Custom CMS | Off-the-shelf (WordPress/Drupal) |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Security** | Minimal attack surface; no known exploits in public databases | Frequent target of automated attacks; thousands of known vulnerabilities |
| **Performance** | Lean codebase; only the features BCC needs | Bloated with unused features, plugins, and overhead |
| **Tailored UX** | Admin interface designed specifically for BCC staff workflows | Generic admin panels requiring adaptation |
| **Maintenance** | No dependency on third-party plugin updates that may break functionality | Constant plugin and core updates required |
| **Ownership** | BCC owns 100% of the code; no licensing concerns | Dependent on open-source community and plugin developers |
| **Bilingual** | Native dual-language architecture built from the ground up | Relies on third-party translation plugins |

#### 2.2 Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Front-end** | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React or Next.js) | Modern, fast, responsive UI with excellent SEO capabilities |
| **Back-end** | Node.js / Python (Django/Flask) | Robust, scalable server-side framework |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Enterprise-grade relational database; excellent for multilingual content and document metadata |
| **CMS Admin Panel** | Custom-built dashboard | Intuitive admin interface tailored to BCC workflows |
| **Hosting** | Cloud VPS (AWS / DigitalOcean) | High availability, scalable, with data centres in proximity to Southern Africa |
| **CDN** | Cloudflare | Global content delivery for fast page loads across Angola, Namibia, and South Africa |
| **SSL/Security** | Let's Encrypt SSL + WAF | HTTPS encryption and web application firewall |
| **Analytics** | Built-in visitor analytics + Google Analytics | Hit counter and detailed traffic analytics as required by TOR |

#### 2.3 Design Approach -- Three Concepts

As required by the TOR, we will propose **three distinct design concepts** for BCC's consideration:

**Concept 1 -- "Ocean Authority"**
A bold, authoritative design with deep ocean blues and clean lines. Emphasises BCC's role as a serious intergovernmental body. Features large hero imagery of the Benguela Current ecosystem, structured navigation, and a formal yet accessible layout.

**Concept 2 -- "Living Ecosystem"**
A vibrant, dynamic design inspired by the marine biodiversity of the BCLME. Uses rich photography, animated ocean elements, and a colour palette drawn from the sea. Interactive maps and visual storytelling are central features. Designed to engage a broader audience including students and the general public.

**Concept 3 -- "Connected Shores"**
A warm, collaborative design emphasising the partnership between Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. Features the three nations' colours as accent tones within BCC's brand palette. Clean, minimal layout with emphasis on readability and accessibility. Suited for a diverse multilingual audience.

All three concepts will be:
- Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Compliant with WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards
- Reflective of BCC's corporate identity and branding guidelines
- Presented as interactive mockups for BCC review

#### 2.4 Key Features & Functionality

2. **Prioritise** -- Work with BCC to identify content to migrate, update, or retire
3. **Migrate** -- Transfer all approved content to the new platform with proper categorisation
4. **Verify** -- Cross-check all migrated content for accuracy and completeness
5. **Redirect** -- Implement URL redirects from old pages to new pages to preserve SEO and prevent broken links

#### 2.6 Security Measures

- SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS) on all pages
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) via Cloudflare
